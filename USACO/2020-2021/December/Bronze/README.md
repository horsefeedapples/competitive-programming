# Overall Thoughts
Yay. I qualified(hopefully) from Bronze to Silver with a score of **833**. Full solved the first 2 and went for partial credit on the last one. Difficulty disribution was pretty bad(very easy, easy, very hard).

# Problems

## Do you know your ABCs
Did a brute for for the memes with `O(n^7)` and checked every possible pair. Could have solved with sorting the 7 inputs, and outputting `a[0],a[1],a[6]-a[1]-a[0]`. Pretty simple overall, took 10 minutes.

Overall: `O(1) or O(n^7)` **10/10**

## Daisy Chains
Iterated through every possible range and counted every flower in the range and found average. Then iterated through all of those flowers again to check if any of them matched the average `O(n^3)`

Overall: `O(n^3)` **10/10**

## Stuck in a Rut
I don't like hard problems. Tried to actually solve this in 3 hours, but ran into issues I didn't feel like fixing so I decided to simulate :pensive:. I don't even know how I managed to simulate it.
To solve, I moved each cow in it's respective direction by 1 by simulating 101 times, and made sure that it had not been visited by another cow at least 1 time unit away. If the cow ended up at a pos 101, then it would have gone an infinite amount of distance

# Conclusion
It was an unbalanced contest, and was sad to see some friends not promote. But the questions were pretty decent
